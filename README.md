W2 openFramework
My first work is called Bouncing Ribbon, which is developed using openFrameworks. The project showcases the beauty of the sine function by using it to control the motion of several circles, which appear to move in a flowing, ribbon-like pattern. The circles change color between green and blue, creating a soothing and elegant visual experience that evokes the movement of silk or water.

W3 openFramework + Mouse interaction

My second work is called My Purple Dream, which is inspired by a dream. The goal was to replicate the dream's imagery of moving purple shapes in an interactive and engaging way. The final outcome is a program that generates a circle with a random color and direction when the user clicks the mouse. The circle then moves in the specified direction and gradually reduces in size, creating a dreamlike ambiance with shades of purple.

W4 openFramework + Arduino
In this project, openFrameworks was used to control the on and off of an LED connected to an Arduino board. This project demonstrates the versatility and ease of use of openFrameworks for hardware integration and physical computing projects.

W6 webscraper
Web scraping is a powerful technique for extracting data from websites. In this project, I built a webscraper using Python to parse the title, link and tag from a target website. The scraper used the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML content of the website and extract the desired information. The extracted data was then stored in a json form for further analysis.

W8 style-transfer

This week I explored the fascinating world of style transfer using TensorFlow. I was amazed at how easily I could use pre-trained models to transfer the style of one image onto another. The process involved loading a pre-trained model and extracting the style and content features from the input images. The style features were then used to reconstruct a new image with the content features from the input image.

I experimented with different styles and input images, and it was incredible to see how different styles could completely transform the look and feel of an image. It was also interesting to see how changing the weight of the style and content loss functions affected the output .
